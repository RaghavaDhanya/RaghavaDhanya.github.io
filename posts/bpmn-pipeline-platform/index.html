Moreover, platforms’s support for human-in-the-loop processes addressed a critical gap in conventional pipelining systems, offering robust mechanisms for human validation and approval—a necessity in the realm of machine learning and MLOps where human intervention is often required.\nA simple example: In this post, I will showcase a BPMN-based analytics automation and pipeline orchestration platform that I led at Mu Sigma Labs. The platform was used by about 3,000 internal users, handling critical reporting and data pipelines.\nThe Challenge The platform was designed to automate and orchestrate complex analytics workflows, including data pipelines, machine learning models, and human-in-the-loop processes. The key challenges were:\nScalability: The platform needed to support thousands of users and hundreds of concurrent pipelines. Flexibility: The platform had to accommodate diverse use cases, from simple approval workflows to complex machine learning pipelines. User Experience: The platform had to be user-friendly, enabling both technical and non-technical users to design and execute workflows with ease. The Solution We didn’t have to start from scratch. We used Activiti, an open-source BPMN engine, as the core of the platform. Activiti provided a robust foundation, enabling us to focus on enhancing the platform’s capabilities and user experience. We extended Activiti to support scripting tasks, human-in-the-loop processes, and dynamic triggers, enabling users to design and execute sophisticated analytics workflows with ease.\nWe used the following tech stack:\nBackend: Java, Activiti Frontend: Angular Scripting: R, Python Database: PostgreSQL The major extensions we made to Activiti were:\nScripting tasks: Key to Automation We integrated R and Python scripting into the platform to enable sophisticated automation tasks. This capability allowed us to design complex pipelines like propensity-to-click prediction model involving user input, predictive modeling, and approval workflows. Example: User tasks: Human in the loop User tasks, including forms and approvals, were seamlessly integrated with email notifications and the assigned user can use the link in the email to submit form or approve the task. This notification could include some context from the previous tasks by attaching documents. Dynamic Triggers Our platform supported diverse trigger mechanisms, including cron-based schedules and REST APIs, ensuring seamless integration with external systems for task initiation.\nThe Usecases Pure Pipelining Example You can also use it as simple pipelining by chaining just scripting tasks. Example: Human in the loop A human in the loop pipeline where the user has to approve the model before deploying it. My Key Contributions During my tenure, I focused on:\nEnabling scripting support for R and Python Enhancing Logging and Observability of these tasks. Implementing timer and dynamic events. Implementing dynamic user task assignments. Improving scalability and modularity of the platform Addressing user interface enhancements and optimizations Building example models and pipelines to showcase the platform’s capabilities. Recognition ⭐️ For my contributions, I received a spot award.
