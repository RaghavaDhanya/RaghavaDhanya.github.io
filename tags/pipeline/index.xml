Think of it as a flowchart for business processes. It is widely used in the industry for modeling business processes.
Now, why would you use BPMN for automating / pipelining? We don&amp;rsquo;t use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML&lt;/a> for writing software right? Yes, but BPMN&amp;rsquo;s adoption for automation and pipelining stemmed from its ability to cater to both technical and non-technical users. Whether orchestrating simple data flows or complex machine learning pipelines, BPMN empowered users to architect automated workflows with ease and flexibility.
Moreover, platforms&amp;rsquo;s support for human-in-the-loop processes addressed a critical gap in conventional pipelining systems, offering robust mechanisms for human validation and approval—a necessity in the realm of machine learning and MLOps where human intervention is often required.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
