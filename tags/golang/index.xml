Thankfully its one of the simpler model of Recommendation systems, Multi Armed Bandit(MAB). Multi Armed bandit usually involves sampling from distribution like Beta Distribution. That&amp;rsquo;s where the most time is spent. If we can concurrently do as many sampling as we can, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the resources well. Maximizing Resource utilization is the key to reducing overall resources needed for the model.</description></item></channel></rss>
