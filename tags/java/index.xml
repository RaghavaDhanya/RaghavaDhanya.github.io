One of the goals was to create a high velocity trading app using Pair Trading.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Long trades are buying a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)">security&lt;/a>. Short is selling a security even when you don&amp;rsquo;t own it. It generally means that you are borrowing someone&amp;rsquo;s securities and selling them in the hopes of buying it back for lower cost later and returning it and hence, making a profit. You don&amp;rsquo;t really have to do it though; exchanges take care of it and let you sell when you don&amp;rsquo;t own a security.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Showcase: BPMN Pipeline Platform</title><link>https://ai.ragv.in/posts/bpmn-pipeline-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 20:54:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ai.ragv.in/posts/bpmn-pipeline-platform/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation">Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)&lt;/a> is a graphical notation standard for business processes. Think of it as a flowchart for business processes. It is widely used in the industry for modeling business processes.
Now, why would you use BPMN for automating / pipelining? We don&amp;rsquo;t use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML&lt;/a> for writing software right? Yes, but BPMN&amp;rsquo;s adoption for automation and pipelining stemmed from its ability to cater to both technical and non-technical users. Whether orchestrating simple data flows or complex machine learning pipelines, BPMN empowered users to architect automated workflows with ease and flexibility.
Moreover, platforms&amp;rsquo;s support for human-in-the-loop processes addressed a critical gap in conventional pipelining systems, offering robust mechanisms for human validation and approval—a necessity in the realm of machine learning and MLOps where human intervention is often required.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
