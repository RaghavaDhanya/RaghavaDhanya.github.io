Why not add some compiled spice to it to make it faster? Using Cython you can add C++ components to your Python code. Isn&amp;rsquo;t all machine learning and statistics libraries already written in C and Cython to make them super fast? Yes. But there&amp;rsquo;s still some optimizations left on the table. I&amp;rsquo;ll go through how I optimized some of our sampling methods in the recommendation system using C++.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Go faster with Go: Golang for ML Serving</title><link>https://ai.ragv.in/posts/golang-for-machine-learning-serving/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 21:36:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ai.ragv.in/posts/golang-for-machine-learning-serving/</guid><description>&lt;p>So the ask is to do &lt;strong>3 Million Predictions per second&lt;/strong> with as little resources as possible. Thankfully its one of the simpler model of Recommendation systems, Multi Armed Bandit(MAB).
Multi Armed bandit usually involves sampling from distribution like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta Distribution&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s where the most time is spent. If we can concurrently do as many sampling as we can, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the resources well. Maximizing Resource utilization is the key to reducing overall resources needed for the model.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
