&lt;p>Long trades are buying a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)">security&lt;/a>. Short is selling a security even when you don&amp;rsquo;t own it. It generally means that you are borrowing someone&amp;rsquo;s securities and selling them in the hopes of buying it back for lower cost later and returning it and hence, making a profit. You don&amp;rsquo;t really have to do it though; exchanges take care of it and let you sell when you don&amp;rsquo;t own a security.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
